- [**webapp.yaml**](https://github.com/StefDS/webapp/blob/master/k8s/webapp.yaml) for POD deployment & stateless service endpoint definitions in K8s.
- [**webapp-kubedir.json**](https://github.com/StefDS/webapp/blob/master/k8s/webapp-kubedir.json) to show the deployment of statefull applications using [KubeDirector](https://github.com/bluek8s/kubedirector)
